Common build tools for extra-* packages.<br>
ðŸ“¦ [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extra-build),
ðŸ“œ [Files](https://unpkg.com/extra-build/),
ðŸ“° [Docs](https://nodef.github.io/extra-build/).

**Why** do packages need to be **built**? For [TypeScript]-based source
libraries (such as this) our main priority is to **generate JavaScript file(s)**
which can be imported from the runtime ([Node.js]), and **publish** them to a
**package registry** such as [NPM]. In addition we might like to generate
associated [type declarations] (`.d.ts` file), which is one of the reasons
behind choosing to write in TypeScript. We might also like to **bundle** all
scripts (and type declarations) into a single file to help reduce package size,
dependencies, or eliminate unused code.

**Documentation** plays a key role in reducing the amount of time spent on
[Stack Overflow], and thus must be maintained at all costs. Instead of manually
updating it, most developers choose to **generate** this from **documentation**
**comments** in the code. An `Index` can be added to the `README` file that
**links to documention**. Thus we have a new build step. In addition, we might
like to **update package metadata** (in `package.json` or *GitHub repo*), build
source files for **another platform** (such as the *web*), **update package**
**version** automatically, **generate wiki files** (for code examples), or
**publish** to [GitHub packages].

This package provides utility functions for all of these operations, and more.
The previous version of this package provided a [CLI] for all of these
operations, but was inflexible in its design (it could only be used when the
source code was arranged is a very specific way). This redesigned version
provides a **JavaScipt API** instead that allows for **significant**
**customization**, in addition to providing a number of helper functions commonly
used in build steps. Build steps can be written in a script file, say
`build.js`, and executed on a *CI system* such as [GitHub Actions] using
`.github/workflows/*.yml`.

Standalone **symbol name** of a package, such as `@package/submodule`, can be
obtained with [symbolname] (i.e., `package_submodule`). This is necessary when
*webifying* (making it accessible with a `script` tag) a package. **Keyword**
**name** for an identifier can be procured with [keywordname], which can then be
used to set the *keywords of a package* in the *metadata file* `package.json`.

**Logging** of *error*, *warning*, *log*, and *info* messages with *colors* is
provided with [error], [warn], [log], and [info] respectively. A *shell command*
can be executed (displaying the command and its output) with [exec]. The
*output* of a command can be obtained as a `string` with [execStr].
Reading/writing of *text/JSON* files is possible with convenience methods
[readFileText], [writeFileText], [readJson], and [writeJson]. To save the
*status* and *contents* of a file (*without* having to do any *existence check*)
is possible with [readDocument] and [writeDocument]. They are useful when it is
required to update a file *temporarily* and *restore* it later (if it exists, or
remove if it did not exist).

Helper `git` commands for *commit+push*, and setting up a *new branch* and
*pushing* *to remote* (for `gh-pages`) is available as [gitCommitPush] and
[gitSetupBranch]. A JavaScript file can be *bundled* (to a single file) with
[bundleScript], and *webified* (for access on the web) with [webifyScript]. A
*banner* can be added to the generated script with [addBanner]. To parse a
*GitHub URL* (for example from the `repository.url` field in `package.json`)
[parseGithubUrl] can be used. *GitHub repository* *details* can be updated (by
default from `package.json`) with [updateGithubRepoDetails].

The *metadata file* of a package (`package.json`) can be read/written with
[readMetadata] and [writeMetadata] respectively. The *current registry* being
used for publishing to *NPM* (in `.npmrc` file) can be obtained with [registry],
and modified with [setRegistry]. The *latest version* of a package can be
obtained with [latestVersion], and the *next unpublished version* (based on the
latest package version, and the `version` mentioned in `package.json`) can be
obtained with [nextUnpublishedVersion].

**JsDoc** for a package can be *generated* with [generateDocs], and published
with [publishDocs]. **Reflection information** of *docs* can be obtained from
the *source file* (through `typedoc`) with [loadDocs]. This can then used to
obtain detailed information on *exported* *symbols* using [docsName],
[docsLocation], [docsFlags], [docsKind], [docsChildCount], [docsParameterCount],
[docsSignatureCount], [docsType], [docsDescription], and [docsReturns]. For
*reference symbols*, the *referred to* *symbol* (which has all the type
information) can be obtained with [docsRefer]. *Simplified details* of a
*reflection (symbol)* can be obtained with [docsDetails] and [docsReferDetails]
(get details of *referred to symbol*).

*Reference code block* for `wiki` can be generated with [wikiCodeReference],
*example code block* can be generated with [wikiCodeExample], and *full*
*markdown text* can be generated with [wikiMarkdown]. The *"Index"* table of
`wiki` or `README.md` can be updated (using *simplified details of exported*
*symbols*) with [wikiUpdateIndex], and *link references* (named links in
markdown) can be updated with [wikiUpdateLinkReferences]. Finally a package can
be published to *NPM* with [publish], and to *GitHub* with [publishGithub].

Behind the dial, these are the gears that make this package tick. TypeScript is
compiled with [tsc], bundled with [rollup], webified with [browserify] and
[terser]. Documentation is generated with [typedoc], which is also used to
obtain `DocsDetails` in order to update index table in `README` using
[extra-markdown-text], generate wiki files, and update package metadata locally
and on *GitHub* repo using [@octokit/rest]. Updating of package versions is
achieved with [npm view] and [semver]. To spice up the console with colors,
[kleur] is used.

The **goals** for the future include generating example file for [RunKit],
linking wiki from JsDoc, and duplicating example code from wiki to JsDoc. Did
you find a bug? Or have a feature request?
